This is the README file for the TEDtoChina project.

TEDtoChina was created in Oct. 2008 as an experiment to build a community of Chinese TED fans on the Internet. It has since witnessed the rapid growth of the TED fans community in China. We get the inspirations mainly from the opensource community, and we want to give back. So we put the sourcecode of the website here for anyone who might be interested.
